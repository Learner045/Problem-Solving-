1) Inorder to avoid duplicate values without using set or additional data structure, we just skip that value during iteration itself when array is sorted


Imp: works only when array is sorted. 
eg. nums[i] - nums[j] == k
   Arrays.sort(nums); //imp
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length-1; i++){
         if(i>0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1])continue; //to avoid duplicate
          for(int j=i+1; j<nums.length; j++){
            if(j>(i+1) && nums[j] == nums[j-1])continue; //to avoid duplicate
              int val = Math.abs(nums[i]-nums[j]);
              if( val == k)pairs++;
              if(val>k)break; //optimization 
           }
         }
         
   
2)  DeMorgan's law of negation
   no overlap
  start1 >= end2 or end1 <= start2
  overlap if start1 < end2 and end1 > start2

3)TreeMap data structure (java) which uses the balanced-binary-search tree.

The great advantage we get with a balanced BST is that the search/add/remove operations are all bounded by a logarithmic complexity
in terms of the number of elements in the tree. This is achievable due to the structure of the tree and the relationship between the subtrees and a root.


4)Binary Search inbuilt method
Note: Arrays.binarySearch() method returns index of the search key, if it is contained in the array, else it returns (-(insertion point) - 1). 
The insertion point is the point at which the key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first element greater than the key, or a.length
if all elements in the array are less than the specified key.


5)Lookups in a hashset, though requiring a constant time, are expensive compared to the direct memory access.
